# ULIGHT
A CSS/JavaScript Framework to add some original style to the web pages.

## Purpose of the project
The goal is to provide a useful Front-End Framework to help developers building original websites. The purpose of Ulight is to propose various styles based on designed templates.

**Ulight is build by a team of passionated and implicated juniors.**

Our goal is to make it easy for beginners to contribute to an Open Source project. It can be hard to make your first Pull Request or to even understand well how an Open Source project is built! But YOU ARE NOT ALONE! 

Every developers had started one day and was a beginner. Here we are still beginners as well, but we are hungry to learn!

**If you feel lost, if you are just a young developer and are looking for a project to learn and to be a part of the community, you are more than welcome!** We try to keep this repository clean and well organized and to give you all the keys needed to be able to participate, even if you are new in coding!

Take a look to this README, read the documentation associated, surf inside the folders and read the code. If there is anything unclear, that's maybe because we didn't pay enough attention to that! So let us know where you are stuck and we will add the resources needed in order to make your journey through this project as pleasant as possible!

## Getting Started
The project has no version to test yet. You can fork the project and pull it in your computer to have a full access to the files.

# Requirements
The project is using [Normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) and [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/), so you should take a look to them.

Here is a [GET STARTED SASS TUTORIAL](https://fr.slideshare.net/MaevaNAP/get-started-sass-tutorial-for-ulight-project)

To compile sass files we are using [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com) with several tasks (Sass, rename, watch and BrowserSync). To start using gulp, you have to install [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm). In terminal (using terminal short introduction)[https://www.davidbaumgold.com/tutorials/command-line/] you have navigate to Ulight project folder in terminal (hint: on mac you can type ```cd``` to leave the current destination, type again ```cd``` and drag project folder to the terminal window and press Enter ) and install dev-dependencies with ```npm install --only=dev```. Then you have just to run ```gulp``` in terminal (hint: just type "gulp" and press enter) to start compiling sass files automatically on save, reload the browser when save changes to html,css,js files. To stop the process, use key combination ```ctr+c``` in your terminal window. If you are interested more in gulp, there is great tutorial under this [link](https://andy-carter.com/blog/a-beginners-guide-to-the-task-runner-gulp).

Also, you can create a [Trello](https://trello.com/) account as we will use this tool to stay organized.
