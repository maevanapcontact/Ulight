# ULIGHT
A CSS/JavaScript Framework to add some original style to the web pages.

## Purpose of the project
The goal is to provide a useful Front-End Framework to help developers building original websites. The purpose of Ulight is to propose various styles based on designed templates.

**Ulight is build by a team of passionated and implicated juniors.**

Our goal is to make it easy for beginners to contribute to an Open Source project. It can be hard to make your first Pull Request or to even understand well how an Open Source project is built! But YOU ARE NOT ALONE! 

Every developers had started one day and was a beginner. Here we are still beginners as well, but we are hungry to learn!

**If you feel lost, if you are just a young developer and are looking for a project to learn and to be a part of the community, you are more than welcome!** We try to keep this repository clean and well organized and to give you all the keys needed to be able to participate, even if you are new in coding!

Take a look to this README, read the documentation associated, surf inside the folders and read the code. If there is anything unclear, that's maybe because we didn't pay enough attention to that! So let us know where you are stuck and we will add the resources needed in order to make your journey through this project as pleasant as possible!
