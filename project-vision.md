# Vision of the project

Ulight is a CSS and JavaScript Framework to add style in the HTML documents.
The goal is to propose new kind of design to break the fact that many websites look the same because they all have the same set of rules.

## How the project is divided?
### The Themes
We work on visual themes (web design) to implement into the Framework. The goal is to propose some original themes (set of buttons, borders, grids and so on) that the coders will translate in CSS classes and JavaScript scripts.

### Framework
The Framework by itself will include the CSS and JavaScript files for the users should re-use the predifined designs made by the web designer team.

### Website
The website will present the project and people should propose their set of designs to be implemented into the official Framework.
