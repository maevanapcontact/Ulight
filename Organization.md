# Organization 
The organization will be based on the Agile one to let a chance to everybody to contribute efficiently and to make improvements to the project day after day and with iteration.

## How we work?
### Define the project
You should find the vision of the project in the file project-vision.md to see where we want to go.

### Break the Project into main tasks
We create stories where we discuss about a feature we want to add for the user and then we brainstorm to know the importance of this new feature on the product. We do that for different features we wish to implement.

### Classify the main tasks
We study all the main tasks possible for us to edvelop and then classify them in priority order. Then we store them in a tool as Trello to keep a track on them.

### Break the main task in sub tasks
We choose the first task to develop and then break it in many tasks. The tasks will be free for everybody wants to make it and we should follow their progress in Trello.

### Implement
When the sub-tasks are finished and the main task is done, we implement the feature.

### Redo
We redo that until we have clean all the main tasks :)

## What to do?
The project is in the initialization phase, so we have to define it clearly.

The first tasks to do after defining it are:
- Define the tools we will use
- Make some tutorials about those tools to train people who don't know them
- Define the structure and the content of the website
- Define the UX of the Website
- Make the Web Design of the website
- Choose a name and a logo
